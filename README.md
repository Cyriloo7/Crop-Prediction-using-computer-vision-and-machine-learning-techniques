# Crop-Prediction-using-computer-vision-and-machine-learning-techniques


The project aims to develop a crop prediction system using image processing, machine learning, and deep learning techniques. The system will leverage YOLOv7, a state-of-the-art object detection model, to identify different types of crops accurately and provide real-time updates on crop health. The proposed system will also use environmental factors such as soil quality, moisture, and temperature to recommend alternative crops to farmers, leading to sustainable agriculture practices. 

The system's ability to identify crops accurately and provide real-time updates on crop health can help farmers take timely actions to improve crop yields and reduce losses. By recommending alternative crops based on environmental conditions, the system can help farmers diversify their crops and reduce soil degradation, leading to sustainable agriculture practices.
